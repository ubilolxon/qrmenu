# qrmenu

QR code menu SaaS for restaurants. Go API (JSON) + separate SPA, PostgreSQL,
shared-table multi-tenancy.

Full architecture and build plan: `~/work/summary_files/qr-menu-saas-architecture.md`

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make up          # postgres :5433, redis :6379, minio :9000 (console :9001)
make migrate     # apply schema
make run         # API on :8080
```

```bash
curl localhost:8080/healthz   # liveness — no dependencies touched
curl localhost:8080/readyz    # readiness — reports postgres and redis
```

`make help` lists everything else.

## Layout

```
cmd/api          HTTP server
cmd/migrate      goose migration runner
internal/config  environment → validated Config, resolved once at boot
internal/domain  pure business types and rules — imports no infrastructure
internal/postgres  pool, embedded migrations, sqlc output, repositories
internal/http    router, middleware, handlers, DTOs
internal/cache   Redis (public menu cache; never on a write path)
web/             SPA (separate build)
deploy/          Dockerfile, docker-compose
```

The rule that keeps this navigable: **dependencies point inward.** `internal/domain`
imports nothing from `postgres`, `http`, or any vendor SDK. When domain code needs
persistence it declares an interface and `postgres` implements it.

## Health endpoints

`/healthz` is liveness and deliberately touches nothing — a database outage is
never fixed by restarting the API, so it must not cause a restart loop.

`/readyz` is readiness. Postgres failing returns 503 and pulls the instance out
of the load balancer. Redis failing returns 200 with `"status": "degraded"`,
because a cache miss falls through to Postgres and a Redis blip should not take
down a healthy fleet.

## Multi-tenancy

Two levels: a **tenant** is the paying account, a **restaurant** is one of its
branches. Billing counts across a tenant; menus, tables and orders belong to a
restaurant.

Isolation is shared tables with a tenant column. The one failure mode that
matters is a query missing its scope, so:

1. Every repository method takes the scope as its **first argument** — there is
   no `GetItem(ctx, id)`, only `GetItem(ctx, restaurantID, id)`.
2. The scope comes from the verified JWT via middleware, **never** from a
   request body or query parameter.
3. Queries are hand-written SQL (sqlc), so the predicate is visible in review.
4. Postgres RLS is added in Phase 7 as a backstop.

## API

Admin surface (`/api/v1/admin`). Public and staff surfaces arrive in Phases 3 and 5.

| Method | Path | Auth | Roles |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | — | creates a tenant and its first owner |
| POST | `/auth/login` | — | |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | refresh cookie | rotates the token |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | refresh cookie | revokes the session family |
| GET | `/me` | bearer | any |
| GET | `/restaurants` | bearer | owner, manager |
| POST | `/restaurants` | bearer | owner |
| GET | `/restaurants/{id}` | bearer | owner, manager |
| PATCH | `/restaurants/{id}` | bearer | owner, manager |
| DELETE | `/restaurants/{id}` | bearer | owner |

## Auth

Access tokens are JWTs valid for 15 minutes, held in memory by the SPA. Refresh
tokens are opaque 32-byte random strings stored only as a SHA-256, delivered in
an `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` cookie scoped to `/api/v1/admin/auth`.
Passwords use argon2id with the parameters encoded in each hash, so they can be
raised later without invalidating existing passwords.

Refresh tokens **rotate**: using one consumes it and issues a replacement in the
same family. Presenting an already-consumed token means it leaked, so the entire
family is revoked — the attacker and the legitimate client are both logged out.
A forced re-login beats a persistent intruder.

Login returns the same error for an unknown address and a wrong password, and
spends the same CPU either way, so the endpoint cannot be used to discover which
addresses are registered.

## Testing

```bash
make test                                   # unit tests only
DATABASE_URL=... go test ./internal/service  # + tenant-isolation suite
```

`internal/service/tenant_isolation_test.go` is the file to keep honest. It runs
against a real Postgres and asserts that one tenant cannot read, modify, or
delete another's rows through any service method — and that the refusal is
"not found" rather than "forbidden", since a 403 would confirm the ID exists.
Fakes cannot catch a missing `WHERE tenant_id`; only a real database can.
**Every new tenant-scoped method needs a case there.**

## Status

- **Phase 0** — skeleton, config, migrations, health, compose, CI.
- **Phase 1** — tenants, users, argon2id passwords, JWT + rotating refresh
  tokens, roles, restaurants CRUD, tenant-isolation suite.
- **Phase 3 is the milestone to aim at**: public menu endpoint + QR generation
  is the first thing you can demo on a phone.
